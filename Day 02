DAY 2: Basic Linux Commands

Basic Linux commands are fundamental tools for interacting with a Linux operating system. They include commands like "ls" (list files and directories), "cd" (change directory), "mkdir" (create directories), "rm" (remove files or directories), "cp" (copy files), "mv" (move files), and "sudo" (execute commands with superuser privileges). These commands are the building blocks for managing files, directories, and system tasks in a Linux environment.

1- To check your present working directory (PWD):
(pwd)
This command will display the current directory path on the terminal.

2- List all the files or directories including hidden files:
(ls -a)
The ls command lists files and directories, and the -a flag ensures that hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot) are displayed.

3- Create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E:
(mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E)
The mkdir command is used to create directories, and the -p option allows you to create parent directories as needed, ensuring the entire nested structure is created.
