I've just taken the first steps in my DevOps journey. DevOps is an exciting field that combines development and operations to improve software delivery and infrastructure management.

#What is DevOps?
DevOps, short for "Development" and "Operations," is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. It promotes automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and the use of tools to streamline the software development and deployment process. DevOps enhances efficiency, accelerates development cycles, and helps organizations deliver high-quality software more rapidly. It encourages a culture of collaboration, communication, and accountability, leading to improved software delivery and customer satisfaction.
